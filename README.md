# Navi
Hey listen! Twitter is a great tool to see what kind of topics people are
talking about, and get others opinions. There are tons of tools out there
to help you do this, but sometimes you just want something simple.

Navi's gool is to provide a simple way to listen to Twitter, and get a dataset
returned. This tool will use Twitter's public streaming API so you'll be
getting a small percentage of overall tweets, but even ~1% can end up being
tens of thousands of tweets over just an hour. 

You'll provide Navi with a list of keywords, hashtags, or users, and it'll 
start storing them inside a Mongo database.
